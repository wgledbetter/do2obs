# `do2obs`

Other DayOne to Obsidian converters exist, but they don't really format stuff the way I want, and it can't be *that* hard, right?

## Plan

- [ ] Rename photos to YYYY-MM-DD-HHMM
- [ ] Output files should be YYYY-MM-DD-HHMM.md
- [ ] Location metadata should conform to the obsidian-map-view pattern
